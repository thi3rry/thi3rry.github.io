git-overview checks the status of local and remote commits of many git repositories in the same directory.
It's ideal when you work with other people and want to quickly check what was recently committed.

For example, you work on several repositories with remote colleagues in different time zones in your team, and in the morning you want to know what was updated yesterday.

git overview mydirectory will give you that quick overview you need to start your day !
